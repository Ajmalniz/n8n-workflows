# n8n Portfolio - AI-Driven Automation Solutions

## Overview
Welcome to my n8n portfolio! I'm Ajmal, an AI engineer and automation specialist with expertise in n8n, Python, FastAPI, and AI integrations (OpenAI Agents SDK, CrewAI, LangChain). This GitHub repository showcases a collection of n8n workflows designed to streamline business processes in marketing, e-commerce, and customer support. Each workflow demonstrates my ability to deliver scalable, AI-driven automation solutions that save time and drive efficiency.

## Why n8n?
n8n is a powerful, source-available workflow automation platform that integrates with over 400 apps and services. Combined with my expertise in AI integrations, I create tailored solutions that empower businesses to automate repetitive tasks and leverage intelligent workflows. My projects focus on delivering measurable results, such as reducing manual work by 10+ hours/week or improving response times.

   ```
2. **Access n8n**: Open `http://localhost:5678` in your browser.
3. **Import Workflows**: Navigate to each workflow folder, copy the JSON file, and import it into n8n.
4. **Follow Setup Instructions**: Refer to the README in each folder for configuration details (e.g., API keys, credentials).
